# 🧪 Odin Recipes - Potion Edition

Welcome to my coded take on [The Odin Project’s](https://www.theodinproject.com/) HTML recipes project!
This isn’t your average recipe book — it’s a magical archive of potion recipes inspired by the **Harry Potter universe** 🪄✨

## 📚 What’s Inside?

This project includes simple structured HTML pages for the following potions:

- 🧙‍♂️ **Polyjuice Potion** – become someone else (just add hair 🤢)
- 💛 **Felix Felicis** – aka Liquid Luck, brew carefully!
- 💘 **Amortentia** – the most powerful love potion, smells like your crush 😳

Each potion page includes:

- A detailed description
- A list of magical ingredients
- Brewing instructions
- A mystical image to match the mood

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- Basic **HTML5** structure
- Semantic tags
- Image embedding
- Lists & headings
- Styled later with CSS (next step!)

## 🧙‍♂️ My current Journey of this Project

This is my first project in the **Foundations course** of The Odin Project.
I’m using it to practice:

- Writing clean, semantic HTML
- Structuring multiple web pages
- Using Git & GitHub to track my progress like a real dev 👨‍💻
