    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Polyjuice Potion, which is a complex and time-consuming concoction, is
      best left to highly skilled witches and wizards. It enables the consumer
      to assume the physical appearance of another person, as long as they have
      first procured part of that individual's body to add to the brew (this may
      be anything — toenail clippings, dandruff or worse — but it is most usual
      to use hair). The idea that a witch or wizard might make evil use of parts
      of the body is an ancient one, and exists in the folklore and
      superstitions of many cultures. The effect of the potion is only
      temporary, and depending on how well it has been brewed, may last anything
      from between ten minutes and twelve hours. You can change age, sex, and
      race by taking the Polyjuice Potion, but not species.
