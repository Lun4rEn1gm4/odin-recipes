    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Amortentia is the most powerful love potion in existence. It causes a powerful infatuation or obsession in the drinker. It has a distinctive smell that varies according to what each individual finds most attractive. The potion emits steam in characteristic spirals and glows with a pearlescent sheen.

    <ol>
      <li>Begin by infusing the rose petals in hot water until fragrant and soft.</li>
