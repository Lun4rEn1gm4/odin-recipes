    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Felix Felicis, also known as Liquid Luck, is a shimmering golden potion that makes the drinker lucky for a period of time, during which everything they attempt will be successful. It is a tricky potion to make and dangerous if consumed in large quantities, leading to recklessness and overconfidence.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 drops of Morning Dew (collected before sunrise)</li>
      <li>2 crushed Occamy eggshells</li>
      <li>1 pinch of powdered Moonstone</li>
      <li>3 Crushed Gurdyroot leaves</li>
      <li>1 golden snidget feather (symbolic)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons of Salamander blood</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Brewing Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Pour the morning dew and moonstone powder into a brass cauldron.</li>
      <li>Heat gently over a silver flame until lightly simmering.</li>
      <li>Stir clockwise three times while whispering "Fortuna major."</li>
      <li>Add Gurdyroot and crushed Occamy shell; continue stirring until the mixture gleams.</li>
      <li>Slowly pour in salamander blood — the potion should fizz and glow gold.</li>
      <li>Drop in the feather and let the mixture brew for six lunar rotations.</li>
      <li>Bottle carefully. Only a few drops are needed — overuse may result in uncontrollable energy and chaotic optimism.</li>
    </ol>
